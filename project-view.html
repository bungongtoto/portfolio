                    student
                    records, attendance, course schedules, and performance tracking. It also includes role-based access
                    control, ensuring secure and efficient data management. The system aims to improve operational
                    efficiency and foster a seamless learning environment.</p>

                        insights and role-based access for administrators, teachers, students, and parents. It offers a
