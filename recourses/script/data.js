    description:
      "This project is a full-stack eCommerce website built using React and Redux for the frontend, with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL on the backend, following a three-tier architecture. It allows users to browse products by category, add items to a shopping cart, and complete purchases using Stripe for secure payment processing. Users can also manage their account details, view order history, and rate previously purchased products. A planned follow-up to the project includes developing an admin dashboard that will enable administrators to manage product inventory, monitor product performance, and process customer orders efficiently.",

The authentication system is designed to integrate seamlessly into the full-stack application, supporting protected routes and personalized user features.",
